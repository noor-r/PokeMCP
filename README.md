# PokeMCP
PokeMCP: Pok√©mon Battle Simulation System
A comprehensive Pok√©mon data provider and battle simulator built using Python's Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework.

Features
Pok√©mon Data Resource

Fetch detailed Pok√©mon information from the PokeAPI
Access stats, types, abilities, moves, and evolution chains
Available through the pokemon://{name} resource
Battle Simulation Tool

Simulate turn-based battles between any two Pok√©mon
Implements core battle mechanics:
Type effectiveness calculations (super effective/not very effective)
STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)
Status effects (paralysis, burn, poison, sleep, freeze)
Critical hits
Stat modifications
Move-specific effects
Detailed battle logs with emoji indicators
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Internet connection (to access the PokeAPI)
Setup Instructions
For Windows
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
or
uv venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
uv pip install -r requirements.txt


For macOS/Linux
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
The client example script will start the server automatically and demonstrate the functionality:

# Windows
python client_example.py

# macOS/Linux
python3 client_example.py
System Architecture
The system consists of two main components:

MCP Server (pokemcp_server/)

mcp_instance.py: Creates the FastMCP server instance
server.py: Initializes the server and registers resources/tools
pokemon_data.py: Implements the Pok√©mon data resource
battle_simulator.py: Implements the battle simulation tool
Client Example (client_example.py)

Connects to the MCP server
Fetches Pok√©mon data
Initiates battles between random Pok√©mon
Displays formatted Pok√©mon information and battle logs
Battle Mechanics
The battle simulator implements the following mechanics:

Type Effectiveness: Damage is multiplied based on type matchups (2x for super effective, 0.5x for not very effective)
STAB Bonus: Moves matching the Pok√©mon's type get a 1.5x damage boost
Critical Hits: Random chance for 1.5x damage
Status Effects:
Paralysis: 25% chance to skip turn, reduces speed
Burn: Reduces attack, deals damage over time
Poison: Deals damage over time
Sleep: Cannot attack, chance to wake up each turn
Freeze: Cannot attack, chance to thaw each turn
Stat Changes: Moves can boost or lower stats with scaling effects
Recovery Moves: Healing and HP restoration
Multi-hit Moves: Some moves hit multiple times
Known Issues
When using the battle simulator tool, there may sometimes be an error reading the Pok√©mon resource through MCP. The system automatically falls back to direct API calls when this occurs.

Cross-Platform Compatibility
This project is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux by:

Using platform-independent paths
Properly handling module imports
Ensuring all file paths use the appropriate directory separators
For Developers
To extend this project:

Add new battle mechanics in battle_simulator.py
Expand Pok√©mon data retrieval in pokemon_data.py
Create additional tools or resources by registering them with the MCP server
